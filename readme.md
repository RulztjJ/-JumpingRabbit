Jumping Rabbit
This is a simple JavaScript program that simulates a jumping rabbit. The rabbit is represented by a class called Rabbit, which has attributes such as name and position. The rabbit can jump forward a random distance each time the jump() method is called.

Usage
To use this program, simply include the index.js file in your project. You can then create an instance of the Rabbit class and call its jump() method to make the rabbit jump.
